        <h3>Géza Mészöly (18 May 1844, Sárbogárd - November 12 1887, Jobbágyi, Nógrád County) was a Hungarian landscape painter.</h3>
    <p>During his studies in Vienna and Munich, he learnt to paint landscapes in the academic style. After he had returned to Hungary, his style changed. He pursued his sudies at the Academy of Vienna and Munich and became a master of academic landscape painting. After having returned to Hungary his style changed and he painted with particular affection the region of Lake Balaton and the river Tisza as well as the Great Hungarian Plain in his greyish paintings. The artist was almost exclusively a landscapist. The characters of his landscapes were the Hungarian peasants or fishermen. The pearly, vapory effect of the surface of his pictures recall the atmosphere of COROT and the French painting.</p>
    <p>Mészöly was one of the major representatives of the trend that mowed towards plein air. His career started in accordance with Academism, but the Hungarian landscape changed his wiews. His main themes were Lake Balaton, the bank of the Tisza and the Great Hungarian Plain. He took trips all over the country and made sketches. He was sensitive to the characteristic and atmospheric differences of the various landscapes. The size of his oil paintings is not really large as his main aim was not spectacle, either in size or content. He does not even seem to belong in this era since his calm painting style lacks sensational elements. He visited various parts of the Hungary. His landscapes of Lake Balaton and the Tisza in greyish shades have a misty look. He depicted peasants and fishermen in an intimate and idyllic manner. His style became less formal in the 1880s. He attempted to depict atmosphere in his pictures which linked him to Corot and French painting. From 1827 onwards, he lived in Munich, then worked in Paris in 1882 and from 1885 onwards he lived in Budapest and Székesfehérvár. 14 painting of the artist are in the possession of the Hungarian National Gallery. Major works: "Lake Balaton", 1874, "Fishermen’s Cottages", 1874, "Plane Land with Hay Stacks", 1872, "Ranch", 1879, "Hunters", 1882, "Flock of Sheep", around 1885, "Wild Duck Shot Down", "An Autumn Day By Balaton", "On the Shore of Lake Balaton", "Cock", "Chioggia", and "Szigetvár".</p>
